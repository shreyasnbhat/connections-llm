### Auto Connections: A Word-Matching Game
This Python Flask application implements a simple word-matching game called "Auto Connections". The game challenges players to identify sets of four words that belong to the same category, generated by a large language model (LLM).

#### How to Play

1. Start a New Game: Visit the /new_game route. You can optionally provide a theme for the game (e.g., "Movies", "Science Fiction", etc.).
2. Choose Words: The game presents a list of words. Select four words that you believe belong to the same category.
3. Verify Your Choice: Submit your selection. The game will verify if the chosen words belong to the same category.
4. Continue Playing: The game continues until you have correctly identified all the categories or run out of attempts.

#### Features
- AI-Powered Category Generation: The game utilizes Google's Gemini Pro LLM to generate categories and corresponding words.
- Dynamic Themes: Players can choose a theme for the game, allowing for diverse and engaging gameplay.
- Difficulty Levels: Categories are assigned difficulty levels, providing a gradual challenge.
- Attempts: Players have a limited number of attempts to correctly identify categories.

#### Technical Details
- Framework: Flask
- LLM: Google Gemini Pro
- Language: Python
